    <p>[About Marquavin Jermale Watkins 
Marquavin “Qua” Watkins was one of the most incredible people I’ve ever known. We first met 
in high school. At the time, I thought he was a bit immature—I even offered to help him find a 
girlfriend. Funny enough, in the process of helping him, I became that girlfriend. What began as 
friendship laid a strong foundation for the beautiful life we built together. 
Over the years, we got married and had two amazing daughters. Qua was the love of my life and 
a man deeply admired by everyone who knew him. He had this calm, steady presence that 
grounded those around him. I’d often ask him how he stayed so composed in tough situations, 
and he’d tell me, “Babe, a man’s job is to lead. If I’m throwing a fit every time something doesn’t 
go my way, what kind of example is that?” He always knew exactly what to say. 
Qua loved spending time with our daughters, constantly showering them with affection. He 
often said, “If they get daddy’s love, no knucklehead boy can treat them just any kind of way.” 
He also had a passion for grilling, dressing up, and making others smile. He had a vibrant spirit—
 full of laughter, kindness, and faith. 
My favorite memory with him is our wedding day. It was magical, beautiful, and filled with love. 
Tragically, on April 22, 2023, our world was shattered when he was struck and killed by a drunk 
driver. That moment is forever etched in my heart. The pain of losing him never fades, but the 
memories—his radiant smile, our vacations, our date nights—remain alive in my heart. 
Marquavin was a child of God, a loving husband, a devoted father, and a true light in the lives of 
many. This website is my tribute to him and the beautiful legacy he left behind. 
Rest in peace, Marquavin Jermale Watkins. Your legacy lives on through love. ]</p>
